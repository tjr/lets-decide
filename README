Let's Decide - a borda count voting application for the iPhone

The source code is released to the public under the GNU GPL v3. As of
this writing, the GNU GPL is incompatible with the Apple's terms of
distribution for iPhone applications, which pretty much means that
without securing an additional license from the copyright holder, you
can't take this software and publish it through Apple's application
store yourself.

What can you do with the source code, then? You can read it, learn
from it (ostensibly), reuse it in whole or in part in other scenarios
that are more GPL-friendly (such as GNUStep software), etc.
